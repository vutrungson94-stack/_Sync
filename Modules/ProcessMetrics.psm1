# ProcessMetrics.psm1 - CMMI L5: measure the PROCESS, not just the product.
#
# WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
# The platform already had an industrial measurement apparatus for the thing it
# BUILDS: Metrics/OTLP/Prometheus, SLO burn rate, AnomalyDetector, RootCause,
# AutoTuner, AuditLedger, supply-chain provenance. Build duration, cache hit
# rate and failure rate were all measured and trended.
#
# What was NOT measured was the process that produces the platform itself.
# Every structural gate in Tests\Hygiene.Tests.ps1 is a BINARY assertion: red or
# green, at one instant. A gate cannot answer:
#   * is the backlog of a defect class shrinking, or has the dedup process died?
#   * after a class reached zero, does it stay at zero, or does it creep back?
#   * at the current removal rate, when is the remaining backlog finished?
# Those questions need a TIME SERIES of a RATIO, which is what this module
# produces.
#
# DESIGN (L4 floor + L5 curve, deliberately separated)
#   * Tests\process-baseline.json  -> committed "adoptionFloor". An L4
#     regression gate. Works on a FRESH CI CHECKOUT with no history, because
#     the floor is version-controlled. Lowering the floor is a visible,
#     reviewable act; the file's own description forbids editing it to make a
#     red run green.
#   * Tests\TestResults\process-trend.jsonl -> APPEND-ONLY, one line per run.
#     This is the curve. Ephemeral per run and published as a CI artifact with
#     retention, because a committed time series produces merge conflicts on
#     every PR.
#
# Every class here is deliberately computed by DETERMINISTIC STATIC ANALYSIS:
# no timestamps inside a ratio, no randomness, no dependency on whether a test
# happened to be skipped. That is what makes two runs comparable.
# ============================================================================

# silently counted every file under logs/, obj/, bin/, .gbuildcache/ and the
# adoption ratios it produces were wrong - quietly, with no error.

# separator in every entry, so one list is correct on both hosts. That is also the

    .SYNOPSIS
        Production and test source files that participate in process metrics.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Each result carries .Kind = 'production' | 'test'. A class that is about
        PRODUCTION behaviour must filter on it, because otherwise test FIXTURES
        that legitimately mention a contract name (a Pester test asserting a
        handler fired for 'EVT_BUILD_ERROR') get counted as production
        violations. The 2026-09 audit's whole lesson was that a metric and its
        gate disagreeing on a green build destroys the credibility of the trend,
        so the scope is explicit rather than implicit in the caller.

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        File text with WHOLE-LINE and BLOCK comments removed, LINE NUMBERS PRESERVED.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Comments are stripped because they are prose, not code. The hygiene gates
        already made this call, and ProcessMetrics MUST use the SAME
        methodology: a ratio computed one way by the gate and another way by the
        metric would make the two disagree on a green build, which destroys the
        credibility of the whole curve.

        Comment lines are BLANKED, never removed. This version used to drop them
        outright, which silently renumbered every line after the first comment
        block in a file - so the offender list it reports, whose entire purpose is
        to be actionable ("file:line"), pointed at the wrong lines. SDK.psm1:118
        was reported as a hardcoded-English log site; line 118 is the sentence
        "Build state carrying BuildConfig (optional...)" inside a doc comment,
        while the real site was line 166. Anyone acting on that report would have
        edited the wrong code.

    #   * NOT PROSE      a separator, ASCII art, or relayed tool/build output
    #                    -> there is nothing to translate
    # Measured on the shipped tree that split is 223 prose vs 46 non-prose. Forcing

    # `Write-Log (Write-Log -MessageArgs @($($glyphs.gear), $msg))` behind a translation key, which is
    # absurd; excluding the prose instead would let real English sentences escape.
    #
    # The baseline's own note had already recorded the ceiling ("50 of the 565 emit
    # lines are NOT translatable prose ... achievable ceiling ~515/565") but the
    # metric never implemented it, so the class was permanently < 1.0 no matter how
    # much prose was migrated. That makes a ratchet nobody can satisfy, which is the
    # same "metric that cannot fail" defect the string-hash class had.

    # form in this codebase is the mid-line guard:
    #     if ($x) { Write-Log (Write-Log -MessageArgs @($msg)) 'Warn' $State }
    # 44% of user-facing emit lines are mid-line, so the gate was structurally
    # blind to them and reported 100% while ~200 English sentences shipped. A
    # ratchet that cannot fail is worse than no ratchet: it certifies the defect.
    #
    # The verb set is enumerated per OCCURRENCE, so two emits on one line count
    # twice, and Write-Host / Write-Warning are included because they carry much
    # of the user-facing text in Steps/ and Hooks/. Write-Success and Write-Step
    # were listed but are not PowerShell verbs and exist nowhere in the tree.

    # Write-SubLog / Write-LogSafe / Write-ErrorSafe were ALSO absent and were
    # added for the same reason Write-Host was: they are user-facing emit paths.
    # Write-SubLog wraps its argument in
    #     Resolve-LogMessage -Key 'Processing' -MessageArgs @($msg)

    # indistinguishable from having no gate for it at all.

    # Two exclusions keep the denominator honest:
    #   * a GUARD, not an emit: `Get-Command Write-Log` / `Get-Module Logging`
    #     names the verb as an argument. There are hundreds of these and they
    #     emit nothing.

    # a parameter NAME (-NoNewline, -ForegroundColor), the VALUE of a colour

    # block punctuation following the call on the same line ('} catch { }').

        A binary hygiene gate says "not red". This says "worse than the floor",
        which is a strictly stronger and more actionable statement, and it
        survives the specific failure where a class was fixed, drifted back
        quietly, and no single gate noticed because each gate only looked at
        its own line.

        With NO history (fresh CI checkout) the comparison still works because
        the floor is version-controlled - that is the whole reason the floor
        lives in process-baseline.json instead of the ephemeral trend file.

        [Console]::OutputEncoding at module load, but a redirected CI log, a
        legacy code page, or a non-console host still renders U+2581..U+2588 as

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Prices tenant usage into billing lines (control-plane billing input).
.DESCRIPTION
    Pure math over Get-TenantUsageSummary tenant entries
    ({ Tenant, Total, Open, Closed, Critical }) and a rate table
    ({ PerRecord, PerCritical, PerOpen }, each defaulting when absent).
    Amounts round to 2 decimals. Never throws: unreadable entries are skipped.

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Proposes floor raises sustained by history (ratchet input, never applies).
.DESCRIPTION
    Quarterly discipline, mechanized: for each class in -CurrentMetrics, when
    the current adoption AND the last -MinSustained history records carrying
    that class all sit above the committed floor, the class is eligible and
    the proposal is the sustained minimum rounded DOWN to 2 decimals. Returns
    @() when there is no floor, no history, or no sustained improvement. NEVER
    writes process-baseline.json: the operator reviews and applies, which is
    what keeps "raise only on evidence" honest instead of automatic.
